\part{Material Study}

In order to run simulations and localize the acoustic emission events,
we have to study the specimen material very carefully to compute things
like signal velocity through the material, and also understand how the
signal travels within the material, which can be affected by the
orientation of layers in case of composite materials.

\section{Velocity Computation}

The method used to compute the signal velocity is somehow trivial. The
procedures go as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Placing two piezoelectric sensors on the composite structure(wind
  turbine) with pre-defined distance of {\(25cm\)}
\item
  Connecting the components as discussed in the acquisition setup
  section.
\item
  Outside the area between the two sensors, we make {\(n\)} hits using
  the lead tip of a mechanical pencil.
\item
  Recording the hit data into CSV files for further processing.
\end{itemize}

        \label{fig:label}
    \end{figure}

To make it easy for me, i have implemented a Signal class in python with
different modes one for attenuation, velocity calculation, and
localization. Each one has its own feature, but the common attribute
among them is the arrival time. It is calculated with AIC method
(discussed in next part). We know that:\\
{\[velocity = \frac{distance}{time}\]}By which we can compute the mean
velocity of different hits through the following equation:\\
{\[\overline{v} = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}\frac{d}{|t_{i,1} - t_{i,2}|}\]}Where,

\begin{itemize}

\item
  {\(d\)} is the distance between the two sensors that equals
  {\(25cm\)}.
\item
  {\(n\)} is the number of hits.
\item
  {\(t_{i,1}\)} is the arrival time of the signal to sensor {\(1\)} from
  hit {\(i\)}
\item
  {\(t_{i,2}\)} is the arrival time of the signal to sensor {\(2\)} from
  hit {\(i\)}
\end{itemize}

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \scalebox{0.5}{\input{./figures/vel1.pgf}}
        \caption{TOA Visualization }
        \label{fig:label}
    \end{figure}

We ran the experiment three times, but first we tested the the reading
to outliers, like the following figure shows one of the experiments has
an outlier reading, so we have to eliminate it.

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \scalebox{0.5}{\input{./figures/vel2.pgf}}
        \caption{Outlier Visualization }
        \label{fig:label}
    \end{figure}

The final results are summed up in the following table:
\\

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabularx}{0.8\textwidth} { 
			| >{\centering\arraybackslash}X 
			| >{\centering\arraybackslash}X 
			| >{\centering\arraybackslash}X | }
		\hline
		$\bar{v_1}$ & $\bar{v_2}$& $\bar{v_3}$ \\
		\hline
		{\(4107.52m/s\)} & {\(3715m/s\)} & {\(2740.8m/s\)}  \\
		\hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

Clearly, there is slight variations as the we assumed that the blade is
linear and we ignored the {\(y\)} component of velocity. In addition, we
did not consider the problem of line of sight. The signal is not
guaranteed to the take the shortest path between the hit and sensor, it
might take a long curved one. After all, the readings fall within the
reasonable range based on past tests on the host material, which is
carbon fiber.


\section{Attenuation}

This section is concerned with how the signal loses its energy through
traveling from the source to  sensor. Hence, we can answer a lot of
questions regarding the quality of the readings we get from a given hit.

The study can be made through the following procedure:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Placing a piezoelectric sensor on the composite structure.
\item
  Drawing a line through the sensor and it has a {\(i\)} marks each one
  is {\(d(cm)\)} from the previous one.
\item
  Making {\(i\)} hits using the mechanical pencil at each mark
\item
  Recording the data to CSV files for further processing
\end{itemize}

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \scalebox{1.2}{\input{./figures/exp2.tex}}
        \caption{Experiment Visualization }
        \label{fig:label}
    \end{figure}

For this study, we made a {\(7\)} marks equidistant from each other at
{\(5cm\)}, However, {\(10\)} files were recorded, which means we have a
3 files as noise.\\
There are variety of methods to eliminate noise, i have used SNR (signal
to noise ratio), and ignoring negative values which excludes the hit
{\(5,8,10\)}.

    \begin{figure}[htbp]
        \centering
        \scalebox{0.5}{\input{./figures/att1.pgf}}
        \caption{Plotted Hits }
        \label{fig:label}
    \end{figure}
We then compute the amplitude {\(A_{i}\)}(maximum voltage reading in the
waveform), and plot {\(A_{i}\)} against hit {\(i\)} to get a sense of
the nature of energy attenuation.\\

\end{figure}


The second sub-figure represents the fitted curve over the raw data. The
exponential curve is given by the following equation.\\
{\[y \approx 5.482e^{- 0.1976}\]}This means , the study verified the
exponential decay of the signal energy through the composite structure.
