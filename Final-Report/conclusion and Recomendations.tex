\section{Conclusion}
Acoustic emission testing proved to be valuable in ensuring the
structure integrity, and monitoring the health status of different
bodies, e.g. wind turbine Blade.\\
The localization part of the acoustic emission is very interesting. It
opens the doors to implement and test different optimization algorithms.
Some are subtitle for lower computational resources , some convergences
quickly, and so on . We can even blend some together to get the desired
solution. Also, some techniques can be formulated from the scratch to
fit the problem nature, like Delta-T mapping. As we say ``All roads lead
to Rome'', but the important question still is \emph{``when this method
shall be used''}.

\section{Recommendations}
My recommendations for whom is going to work in similar project can be
summarized in the following points:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hybrid algorithms tend to be more stable and converge fast.
\item
  Implement simulated annealing or genetic algorithm, both have great
  performance.
\item
  Tweak the AIC to take less time or implement a similar method.
\item
  Implement a more structured noise filter for attenuation data.
\item
  Avoid many loops which affects the software performance.
\end{itemize}
