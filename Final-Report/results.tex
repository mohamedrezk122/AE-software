\part{Results}
For the sake of clarity, the two algorithms have been tested for number
of iterations and for different hit IDs. To ensure the quality of the
optimization method used I have implemented a discrete brute force
approach to compute the deviation in both {\(x\)} and {\(y\)}.

\section{General Testing}
The following figure shows the localization done by the particle swarm
optimization and the simplex method, besides ,of course, the brute
force.

\section{Deviation Test}
Then, we test the deviation of the two algorithms from the brute force
to see a visual trend over number of iterations. 
For the deviation in {\(y\)} and {\(x\)}:
$$d_i^x = x_i - x_{bf}$$
$$d_i^y = y_i - y_{bf}$$

\section{Thoughts}

Clearly, the PSO has an incredible advantage over simplex optimization
in terms of deviation from the true location of the source. But let us
take a moment here and analyze the situation more closely.\\
The algorithmic complexity of PSO is :\\
{\[\theta(n \times m)\quad,\ m = generations\quad,\ n = particles\]} as
we have to update every particle within a population over the course of
the generation. For instance, I have set the number of generations
{\((m)\)}to {\(100\)} and number of particles {\(n\)} to {\(60\)} which
means around {\(6000\)} iterations have been consumed. On the other
hand, the simplex method is linear. In fact, its algorithmic complexity
can be formulated as :\\
{\[O(n)\quad,\ n = maximim\ iterations\]}Which means that the algorithm
can consume them all or any fraction of this depending on the
convergence check we discussed last section. However, In average, the
simplex optimization took {\(52\)} iteration to finish (no longer can
better the solution), which considered amazing in terms of computational
resources.
PSO is superior to simplex optimization due to the swarm intelligence,
thanks to the stochastic nature. Nevertheless, we can blend the two
algorithms to exploit the fast convergence of the simplex method with
the stochastic nature of the particle swarm, which can make (and i
conjuncture) a stable algorithm.
